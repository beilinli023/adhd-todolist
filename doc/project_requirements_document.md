# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The project is a ToDo list app designed specifically for individual users who find themselves easily distracted. The core purpose of this app is to enhance time management and efficiency by offering a simple yet effective task management tool. The app aims to minimize distractions by facilitating a streamlined method for users to track and complete tasks.

Building this app addresses a common issue among individuals: the struggle to maintain focus amidst many distractions. By providing a user-friendly platform with straightforward features, the app helps users manage their day-to-day activities without the overwhelm of complexity. Success for this app is measured by its ease of use, user satisfaction, and its ability to help users complete their daily tasks more efficiently.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   User account creation and login functionality.
*   Task creation with an intuitive, simple interface.
*   Features to mark tasks as complete, archive, or delete them.
*   Cloud synchronization for data storage and accessibility across devices.
*   A technological and creative design for the user interface.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   No support for multiple user roles or team collaboration features.
*   No integration with third-party calendaring or reminder apps.
*   Subscription models or in-app purchases for monetization are not included.

## 3. User Flow

A new user starts by signing up or logging in to the app. Upon entering, they are greeted with an uncluttered dashboard where they can see their current tasks. The left-hand sidebar offers easy navigation, while the main content area prominently displays the tasks. Users can quickly add new tasks through a simple input interface.

As users complete their tasks, they can mark them off as complete, delete them if no longer needed, or archive them for future reference. The application seamlessly synchronizes data with the cloud, ensuring that task lists are up-to-date whenever accessed. This straightforward flow helps maintain focus and enhances productivity by eliminating unnecessary steps.

## 4. Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** Sign up and login for secure access.
*   **Task Creation:** Simple and quick task creation process.
*   **Task Management:** Options for marking tasks as complete, deleting, or archiving them.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Real-time data sync with cloud storage for accessibility.
*   **User Interface:** Clean and technologically inspired design.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework:** React.js for building the user interface.
*   **Backend Framework:** Node.js for server-side logic.
*   **Database:** MongoDB for storing tasks and user data.
*   **Authentication:** Firebase Auth for managing user identities.
*   **Cloud Storage:** Supabase for cloud data synchronization.
*   **IDE:** Cursor AI for efficient coding with real-time suggestions.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Responsive interface with minimal load times for task management operations.
*   **Security:** Secure storage of user data with proper authentication and authorization measures.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive design that facilitates ease of use and minimizes user training time.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The app is developed to run on web platforms only.
*   The approach assumes continuous availability and reliability of services like Firebase and Supabase for authentication and data storage.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Rate Limits:** Ensure block due to any API call limitations.
*   **Platform Restrictions:** Web-only focus might exclude some users preferring mobile applications.
*   Address user feedback promptly to mitigate issues related to interface usability and performance.

This PRD should provide a clear and thorough understanding of the ToDo list app, allowing subsequent technical documents to be generated seamlessly. The document should empower an AI model to have a powerful guide for development without uncertainty.
